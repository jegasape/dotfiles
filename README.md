# .dotfile!

This is my dotfile, I am using hyprland and I am working on improving my workflow. It is not complete yet because I am trying different configurations to have more options. You can use this configuration as a starting point, but feel free to change it.

> Yeah! arch, btw~

I am using stow, which I find more comfortable to use than "git bare".

You would only have to do a  **`stow */`** or specify which configuration you want to use with **`stow alacritty`** for example.
