# .dotfile!

This is my dotfile for Hyprland, aimed at enhancing my workflow. It's still a work in progress as I'm experimenting with different configurations to expand my options. Feel free to use this as a starting point and customize it to your preference.

I am using Stow, which I find more comfortable to use than 'git bare'.

You only need to run ```stow */```  or specify which configuration you want to use, such as stow alacritty.
