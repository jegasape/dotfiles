# .dotfile!

This is my Hyprland dotfile, designed to improve my workflow. It's still a work in progress since I'm testing out different configurations to add more options. Feel free to use it as a base and tweak it to suit your needs!

Iâ€™m using **Stow** because I find it more comfortable than ```git bare```.

You only need to run ```stow */```  or specify which configuration you want to use, such as stow alacritty.
